# projeto8-ZapRecall

This project is a React App for flash cards to help with the memorization of concepts (similar to the ANKI method). There are 3 default decks built-in: Fibonacci sequency, Factorials and JSX.

## How to Use:

On the homepage you can select one of the three default decks to test yourself and begin by clicking on "Começa ai!!!".

Upon choosing your deck the "Recall" interface will show up where you can click on each question ("Pergunta #") to see the question. After reading the question you can click on the "roundabout" sign to select "Não lembrei!" (didn't remember), "Quase não lembrei!" (almost did not remember) and "Zap!" (remembered).

Your score will be tallied on the bottom of the screen: All correct or correct + almost remembered equals "Parabéns", also known as "Congratulations, you forgot no flashcard". If there are any incorrect answers you'll recieve a "Putz...", also known as "Ouch... some are still missing... But don't give up!".

Upon completion you can click on "Reiniciar Recall" to go back to the home screen.
